## Description
This is a dice roller! 2.0 is the most updated version. It can be used to simulate dice rolls for all dice used in the most popular tabletop games. The program can be run both in the terminal and the console, and the dice type and/or number of rolls can be input in the command line when the program is first run. If the dice type and/or number of rolls is not entered, then the program will prompt the user to enter then. The program will then "roll the dice" and report the individual rolls, as well as the sum of the rolls (if applicable). The user will be asked if they want to roll again; the program will keep running until the user tells it to stop. May the dice gods be ever in your favor!
